Audrey Watters is a writer and independent scholar who focuses on education technology -- its products, its politics, its pedagogical implications.  She has worked in the education field for almost twenty years: as a graduate student, college instructor, and program manager for an ed-tech non-profit. Although she was two chapters into her Comparative Literature dissertation, she decided to abandon academia, and she now happily fulfills the one job recommended to her by a junior high aptitude test: freelance writer.  She has written for *The Atlantic*, *Edutopia*, *Hybrid Pedagogy*, *MindShift*, *Inside Higher Ed*, *The School Library Journal*, and elsewhere across the Web, but she is best known for her work on her own website *Hack Education*. She has given keynotes and presentations on education technology around the world and is the author of several books, including *The Monsters of Education Technology*, *The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology*, *The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology*, and *Claim Your Domain*.
