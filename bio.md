Audrey Watters is a writer and independent scholar who focuses on education technology -- its politics and its pedagogical implications. Although she was two chapters into her Comparative Literature dissertation, she decided to abandon academia, and she now happily fulfills the one job recommended to her by a junior high aptitude test: freelance writer. She has written for *The Baffler*, *The Atlantic*, *Edutopia*, *Hybrid Pedagogy*, *Inside Higher Ed*, *The School Library Journal*, and elsewhere across the Web, but she is best known for her work on her own website *Hack Education*. She has given keynotes and presentations on education technology around the world and is the author of several books, including *The Monsters of Education Technology*, *The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology*, *The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology*, and *Claim Your Domain*. She is a recipient of the Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship at Columbia University for the 2017-2018 academic year.
